Django Fraggle
==============

Manges snippets of content to be rendered into Django pages.

Forked from garethr and the following changes made:

* Optional rendering from textile input
* Render tag references fraggle by title rather than ID
* Admin shows the tag to insert in a page to get the fragment rendered
